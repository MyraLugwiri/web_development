        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas.It is often a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; 
            however there are some banana bread recipes that are yeast raised breads.</p>

        <p>Banana bread recipes began being featured in well-known cookbooks across North America as baking soda and baking powder were being 
            mass produced and becoming available in grocery stores in the 1930s. It appeared in Pillsbury's 1933 Balanced Recipes cookbook, 
            and later gained more acceptance with the release of the original Chiquita Banana's Recipe Book in 1950.</p>
